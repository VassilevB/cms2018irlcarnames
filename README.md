IRL vehicle names besides the fictional names Car Mechanic Simulator 2018

Information is taken mostly from the fandom wiki (https://car-mechanic-simulator-2018.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles), I also compared IRL photos of the respective car models in the regular English wiki (en.wikipedia.org). The mod is only changing in-game vehicle names in the following format:

Fictional Car Model (IRL Car Model)

Similar mods existed in the past (e.g. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1095963518), but are hosted on weird file sharing sites, so this one will hopefully stay "alive" longer.

How to install:
Just replace the "name.txt" files in the corresponding directories of the game (the complete path of the sub-directories inside the default game directory is preserved).

I hope you enjoy.
